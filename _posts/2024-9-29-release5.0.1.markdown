Several important bugs have been fixed in this version.

- [Video finder][1] problems have been fixed.

- The problem of using cookies file has been fixed.

- Passing header issue has been fixed.

- wrong utf-8 file names has been fixed.

- If the download is paused by the user, the downloaded file will not be corrupted.

Maybe! In some distributions, download problems using Socks5 proxies are related to not installing the python3-pysocks package. I'm not sure about that!

New version of [persepolis_lib][2] has been released today.
