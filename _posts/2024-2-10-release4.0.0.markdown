We are happy to announce the release of Persepolis Download Manager 4.0.0 .

In this Version we have some good new features :)

1- Persepolis is rewritten in PySide6 but It's still working with PyQt5. So don't worry if PySide6 is not available for your operating system:)

2-Dependencies have changed. Please check this [link](https://github.com/persepolisdm/persepolis/wiki/git-installation-instruction)

3- [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl) is replaced by [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp). So you can still download videos from YouTube and ... with high quality. [Check out Persepolis wiki for more information.](https://github.com/persepolisdm/persepolis/wiki/How-can-I-download-videos-from-youtube), special thanks to [@jvdi](https://github.com/jvdi)

4- New themes are added. Fusion dark is default theme but you can change it. [Check out Persepolis wiki for more information.](https://github.com/persepolisdm/persepolis/wiki/How-to-change-Persepolis-theme)

5- We fix some of reported bugs. [check out reported bugs.](https://github.com/persepolisdm/persepolis/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Afixed+is%3Aclosed)

### Windows and Mac and Debian packages will be uploaded soon and repositories will be updated soon.
